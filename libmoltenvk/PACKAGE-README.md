# libmoltenvk - Vulkan implementation on top of Apple's Metal

This is a `build2` package for the [`MoltenVK`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK)
C++ library. It implements a subset of the Vulkan 1.4 graphics and compute API
on top of Apple's Metal framework. This package currently targets macOS only.


## Usage

This package builds MoltenVK, Apple's Vulkan-over-Metal ICD. Three ways to
consume it, each with its own working, automated test in the accompanying
`libmoltenvk-tests` package (`direct-driver-loading/`, `icd/`, `bundle/`) or
in this package's own `tests/basics/` (direct-link).
Do not mix ICD mode or direct driver loading with direct-link mode in the
same image: `lib{MoltenVK}` and the Khronos loader both export `vk*`.

### Direct driver loading mode (recommended)

> Build this package's MoltenVK alongside the application, without linking
> it, and hand it to the loader directly at runtime via
> `VK_LUNARG_direct_driver_loading`. Guarantees the application runs against
> this exact, tested build: no ICD json, no environment variable, no
> filesystem search that could instead pick up whatever (or whichever
> version of) MoltenVK happens to already be registered on the machine.

depends: libmoltenvk ^1.4.2 ? ($cxx.target.class == 'macos')
```

```
import  vk    = libvulkan-loader%lib{vulkan}
import! dylib = libmoltenvk%libs{MoltenVK}

exe{app}: cxx{main} $vk
exe{app}: $dylib: include = adhoc

cxx.poptions += "-DMVK_DYLIB_PATH=\"$posix_string($($dylib: libmoltenvk.dylib_path))\""
```

`libs{MoltenVK}` is imported with `import!`, then added as an adhoc
prerequisite of `exe{app}`: building `exe{app}` also builds the dylib, but
never links it, so its `vk*` symbols never
enter the image (the extension exists specifically for drivers like
MoltenVK that also implement the full Vulkan API surface, where a normal
link would collide with the loader's own symbols). At runtime, `dlopen`
`MVK_DYLIB_PATH` with `RTLD_LOCAL` (keeping its symbols out of the
process-wide namespace too), resolve `vk_icdGetInstanceProcAddr` via
`dlsym`, and pass it to the loader through `VkInstanceCreateInfo`'s
`pNext` chain:

```cpp
void* handle = dlopen (MVK_DYLIB_PATH, RTLD_NOW | RTLD_LOCAL);
auto  get_proc_addr = (pfn_vk_icdGetInstanceProcAddr)
  dlsym (handle, "vk_icdGetInstanceProcAddr");

VkDirectDriverLoadingInfoLUNARG ddli {};
ddli.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DIRECT_DRIVER_LOADING_INFO_LUNARG;
ddli.pfnGetInstanceProcAddr = (PFN_vkGetInstanceProcAddrLUNARG) get_proc_addr;

VkDirectDriverLoadingListLUNARG ddll {};
ddll.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DIRECT_DRIVER_LOADING_LIST_LUNARG;
ddll.mode = VK_DIRECT_DRIVER_LOADING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE_LUNARG;
ddll.driverCount = 1;
ddll.pDrivers = &ddli;

// VkInstanceCreateInfo.pNext = &ddll;
```

In a development (out-of-tree) build `libmoltenvk.dylib_path` is an
absolute path to the just-built dylib. `dlopen` that string as-is. After
install the value is a path relative to the installed executable's
directory, so a relocatable prefix still works. `dlopen` of a relative
path is resolved against the process current working directory (POSIX),
not against the binary. An installed app can be launched from any cwd,
so complete that relative path at runtime by resolving the executable's
own path and using its directory as the base before calling `dlopen`.

See `libmoltenvk-tests/direct-driver-loading/` for a complete, working
out-of-tree example, including the extension name and portability flags
on `VkInstanceCreateInfo`. That test `dlopen`s the absolute development
path and does not cover the installed relative-path case.

This extension is designed by LunarG specifically for API translation
layers like MoltenVK. It requires ICD interface version 7, which this
package's `vulkan.mm` is patched to report (see
`src/MoltenVK/Vulkan/vulkan.mm.patch`,
[KhronosGroup/MoltenVK#2663](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/issues/2663)).

### ICD mode (conventional)

> Link only the Khronos loader. MoltenVK is discovered and `dlopen`ed as a
> runtime driver, exactly like any other Vulkan ICD (AMD, NVIDIA, etc). The
> conventional, zero-platform-code way Vulkan applications integrate a
> driver, but with no guarantee it is *this* package's build that gets
> loaded: search path and `VK_ADD_DRIVER_FILES` both pick up whatever ICD
> happens to already be registered on the machine.

depends: libvulkan-loader ^1.4.359
```

```
import vk = libvulkan-loader%lib{vulkan}
exe{app}: cxx{main} $vk
```

A library that only compiles against the loader must never depend on
`libmoltenvk` either, since that would pin one specific ICD onto every
application that links it.

At `vkCreateInstance`, enable `VK_KHR_portability_enumeration` and
`VK_INSTANCE_CREATE_ENUMERATE_PORTABILITY_BIT_KHR` or the loader skips
this driver. That is Khronos policy, not specific to this package.

There is no `depends:` and no `import` in this mode, so nothing in a
consuming application's own `bdep sync`/`bpkg build` pulls this package in.
Building and installing *this* MoltenVK is therefore a separate, manual step
the consumer (or whoever administers the machine) runs once, ahead of time,
to a system default search path. A fresh, disposable `bpkg` configuration
(so this doesn't touch any configuration already in use) pointed at the
`stable` section of `cppget.org` (use `testing` instead if a required
dependency version isn't in `stable` yet):

```
bpkg create cxx config.cxx=clang++ -d /tmp/libmoltenvk-cfg
bpkg add    -d /tmp/libmoltenvk-cfg https://pkg.cppget.org/1/stable
bpkg fetch  -d /tmp/libmoltenvk-cfg
bpkg build  -d /tmp/libmoltenvk-cfg --for install libmoltenvk
bpkg install -d /tmp/libmoltenvk-cfg          \
             config.install.root=/usr/local   \
             config.install.sudo=sudo         \
             libmoltenvk
```

(`bpkg install` on its own only installs a package already configured by
`bpkg build`, hence the two separate steps: see
[`bpkg-pkg-install`](https://build2.org/bpkg/doc/bpkg-pkg-install.xhtml).)
After this the loader finds it exactly like any other installed ICD, no
application-side change at all.

How the loader finds this build of MoltenVK, using the same knobs a
non-`build2` user already has:

- **Search path.** Directories the loader always scans (no environment
  variable). On macOS that includes the app bundle
  `Contents/Resources/vulkan/icd.d/`, then `etc/vulkan/icd.d/` and
  `share/vulkan/icd.d/` under `/usr/local` and `/usr`, i.e. exactly the
  prefix installed above. See `libmoltenvk-tests/icd/`.
- **Environment.** For a prefix the loader doesn't scan, such as Homebrew
  (`/opt/homebrew`), a custom prefix, or an uninstalled out-tree, set
  `VK_ADD_DRIVER_FILES` (additive: adds to the driver list, unlike
  `VK_DRIVER_FILES`, which replaces it) to the json path. Same variable
  the LunarG SDK and a CMake MoltenVK build already use.
- **`.app` bundle.** Copy `json{MoltenVK_icd-bundle}` and
  `libMoltenVK.dylib` into `Contents/Resources/vulkan/icd.d/`. No
  environment variable, no search path configuration: a bundled ICD is
  found by the loader as soon as the app runs from inside the bundle.
  See `libmoltenvk-tests/bundle/`, which assembles a minimal `.app`
  structure (no `Info.plist` needed) and runs it with a completely
  empty environment to prove exactly this.

Installing to a search path does not make the loader prefer this build over
any other registered MoltenVK: every driver manifest found across every
scanned path is loaded and its devices enumerated, there is no single-winner
priority among them. If a different MoltenVK is already registered
(Homebrew, the LunarG SDK, another application's own bundle), both get
loaded side by side, a scenario the loader's own driver-discovery docs
single out by name as leading to potential issues or crashes ([Vulkan-Loader
`docs/LoaderDriverInterface.md`, "Driver Discovery on
macOS"](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Loader/blob/main/docs/LoaderDriverInterface.md#driver-discovery-on-macos)).
`VK_DRIVER_FILES` (replaces the whole list, exclusive, used by
`libmoltenvk-tests/icd/`) is the only environment-based way to guarantee
just this build is considered. For a guarantee that does not depend on the
environment at all, see "Direct driver loading mode" above.

`library_path` in the json is relative to the json file. Relocatable
installation is supported.

GLFW should use the linked loader. Do not call `glfwInitVulkanLoader` in
ICD mode.

Out-of-tree testing of *this* repo (no system MoltenVK installed) is the
one case that legitimately needs the json path before install.
`libmoltenvk-tests/icd/` is the reference for how: a plain
same-configuration import of `json{MoltenVK_icd}` plus Testscript `env` to
scope `VK_DRIVER_FILES` to a single test invocation. That pattern is
dev/CI tooling for this repo, not something application packages should
copy.

### Direct-link mode

> Link `lib{MoltenVK}` as an ordinary C++ library, bypassing the loader
> entirely. For a consumer that only ever wants MoltenVK specifically,
> such as this package's own SPIR-V-to-MSL conversion tooling.

```
depends: libmoltenvk ^1.4.2
```

```
import libs = libmoltenvk%lib{MoltenVK}
```

The target name is mixed-case `lib{MoltenVK}` (not `lib{moltenvk}`) to match
the upstream binary name (`libMoltenVK.dylib`).

Linking against it transitively imports `libvulkan-headers` and the Apple
frameworks required by the public headers (`Foundation`, `Metal`,
`CoreGraphics`). GLFW then needs `glfwInitVulkanLoader(vkGetInstanceProcAddr)`
or it will `dlopen` `libvulkan.1.dylib`.

The ICD json is not used in this mode.


## Importable targets

This package provides the following importable targets:

```
lib{MoltenVK}
libs{MoltenVK}
json{MoltenVK_icd}
json{MoltenVK_icd-bundle}
```

`lib{MoltenVK}` is the compiled library, for direct-link mode only.

`libs{MoltenVK}` is the shared library member specifically, for direct
driver loading mode: imported with `import!` and added as an adhoc
prerequisite (never linked), it exports `libmoltenvk.dylib_path`
metadata giving the dylib's path for `dlopen`.

`json{MoltenVK_icd}` is the out-of-tree ICD manifest. It exists for this
project's own out-of-tree testing (see `libmoltenvk-tests/icd/`) and is
not a general consumer API. Ordinary ICD-mode consumers need neither
`depends` nor `import` on this package at all.

`json{MoltenVK_icd-bundle}` is a static ICD manifest (`library_path`
relative to its own directory) for packagers copying MoltenVK into a
`.app` bundle's `Contents/Resources/vulkan/icd.d/`.


## Configuration variables

This package provides the following configuration variables:

```
[bool]   config.libmoltenvk.use_metal_private_api ?= false
[string] config.libmoltenvk.log_level             ?= 'info'
```

`config.libmoltenvk.use_metal_private_api` mirrors upstream's
`MVK_USE_METAL_PRIVATE_API`. When true, MoltenVK may use private Metal
interfaces to implement some Vulkan features. Default is false (App Store
safe).

`config.libmoltenvk.log_level` mirrors upstream's `MVK_CONFIG_LOG_LEVEL`.
Valid values are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `off`.

`SPIRV-Tools` integration is always excluded in this package
(`MVK_EXCLUDE_SPIRV_TOOLS=1`). Enabling it requires `SPIRV-Tools` and
`SPIRV-Headers` packages that are not available yet.
