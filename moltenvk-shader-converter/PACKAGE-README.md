# moltenvk-shader-converter - SPIR-V to Metal Shading Language shader converter command-line tool

This is a `build2` package for the [`MoltenVK`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK)
project's stand-alone `MoltenVKShaderConverter` command-line tool. It converts
SPIR-V shader code to Metal Shading Language (MSL) source code, for use at
development time from the command line. This package currently targets macOS
only.

As in upstream, the tool links against `libmoltenvk` (the full ICD library)
for the shared conversion implementation.


## Usage

To start using `moltenvk-shader-converter` in your project, add the following
build-time `depends` value to your `manifest`, adjusting the version
constraint as appropriate:

```
depends: * moltenvk-shader-converter ^1.4.2
```

Then import the executable in your `buildfile`:

```
import! mvksc = moltenvk-shader-converter%exe{MoltenVKShaderConverter}
```

It can also be installed and run directly from the command line:

```
MoltenVKShaderConverter -si input.spv -mo output.metal
```


## Configuration variables

This package provides no configuration variables.
